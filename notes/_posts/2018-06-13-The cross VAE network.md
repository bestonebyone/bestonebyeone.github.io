## Discussion With Professor
Yesterday I showed my thoughts to professor and she gave me some valuable suggestions. Here is the memo or reminder.

1. The Estimator which can get one possible solution is hard. Now many people just research on it.
2. It may be unnecessary to get the position of one occluded joint.
3. The diversity or some transfer between the solution space. Some **important references** related to body pose estiamtion should be noted.
4. We talk about the paper <sub>1</sub>. 
    * This idea is novelty.
    * There is no way to measure its performance.
    * Not consider the hand model constraints.
    * Of course, **application** is also an important issue.
