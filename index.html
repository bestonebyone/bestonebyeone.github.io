				<p>I received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in Machine Perception Lab (MPL) from <strong>Beihang University</strong>, with experience in image processing. My past research, aiming to better understand the inherent data structure, are mainly about structure constraint. I have participated in some extremely good research which were submitted to <strong>TIP</strong>(in press), <strong>JSTSP</strong>(in press), <strong>TCSVT</strong>(in submission), etc.. Now I am planning to apply for a Ph.D. position. </p>
